This package provides a simple solution to insert document string into the code. Prerequisite # N/A Usage # You can enable this package to a specific major mode, like ;; Enable `docstr' inside these major modes. (add-hook 'actionscript-mode-hook (lambda () (docstr-mode 1))) (add-hook 'java-mode-hook (lambda () (docstr-mode 1))) If you just want to enable it inside a specific buffer just call docstr-mode as a command throught minibuffer. M-x docstr-mode To enable this package through out all the buffers by default. Call global version of the minor mode; then just put the following code snippet to your configuration. (global-docstr-mode 1) Supported Langauges # Here is a list of all languages that support by this package. ActionScript C / C++ / C# Golang / Groovy Java / JavaScript / JSX Lua PHP / Python Rust Scala TypeScript You can customize docstr-writers-alist variable to add your own document string support for your favourite language. Just add a cons cell like (mode-name . docstr-writer-name) . To create your own document string writer, you would need to create a function that takes in one argument. For instance, (defun my-docstr-writer (search-string) ;; Insert document stirng here. ) Argument search-string will be populated by the triggeration associated list. See variable docstr-trigger-alist for more information. For instance, a C# trigger data is like this (csharp-mode . (\"/\" docstr-trigger-csharp)) And the triggeration function will look like this (defun docstr-trigger-csharp (&rest _) \"Trigger document string inside C#.\" (when (and (docstr--doc-valid-p) (looking-back \"///\" 3)) (save-excursion (insert \" <summary>\\n\") (insert \"/// \\n\") (insert \"/// </summary>\")) (forward-line 1) (end-of-line) (docstr--insert-doc-string (docstr--c-style-search-string 2)))) The document string is triggered by certain conditions are met; and it will finally calls the function docstr--insert-doc-string for document string insertion. In this example, (docstr--c-style-search-string 2) is the search-string ready for document string writer to write a proper document string base on the search-string information. Then this is the result. Before/After Insertion # You can customize document before or after the document string insertion. There are total two hooks you can customize. docstr-before-insert-hook docstr-after-insert-hook The usage of this is to customize the document string with set up. For instance, some programming languages would add @desc before an actual description. Do the following can implement this. (add-hook 'docstr-before-insert-hook (lambda (search-string) (insert \"@desc \"))) Of course, I would recommend you add it locally so it is language specific document style. Let's try apply to language TypeScript only within typescript-mode .

The following are advance examples for document string in C++ . Preprocessor Enumerator Structure Class Document String # You are able to customize default document string by tweaking these variables. Type Name # docstr-format-type - default to \"{ %s }\" The default is wrap around curly brackets. It only takes one %s for type name to plug in. docstr-show-type-name - default to t If you don't want the type name to be shown; then set docstr-show-type-name to nil will make the trick. For instance, if you don't want the type name to be shown in java-mode ; do the following. (add-hook 'java-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local docstr-show-type-name nil))) docstr-default-typename - default to typename You can change this value if you don't like the default type name. This variable is generally use for programming languages that aren't strong type. Like Python , JavaScript , PHP , etc. Variable Name # docstr-format-var - default to \"%s :\" The default is having colon : at the back of the variable name. It only takes one %s for variable name to plug in. Parameter & Return # docstr-format-param - default to @param #T##V##D# docstr-format-return - default to @return #T##V##D# You can customize these variables for different document style. See the following talbe for desciption of key #T# , #V# and #D# . Key Description #T# Key represent type name. #V# Key represent variable name. #D# Key represent description. P.S. These variables are constant value. Default descriptions # Here is a list of default description strings that you are allow to customize.

Configure Faces # This package provides a way to customize the document string faces in a consistent way yet this is just an optional choice. To enable this feature, you can put the following code snippet into your configuration. (docstr-faces-apply) There are three faces that you can customize for document string. docstr-faces-tag-face - Highlight the tag face; like @param , @return , etc. docstr-faces-type-face - Highlight the type name face. docstr-faces-value-face - Highlight the variable name face.
